# Prediction Markets API

Access real-time prediction market data via x402 micropayments. Powered by [Predexon](https://predexon.com).

Unified access to Polymarket, Kalshi, dFlow, Binance, Limitless, Opinion, Predict.Fun, sports markets, plus UMA Oracle resolution data, canonical cross-venue market IDs, and on-chain wallet identity & clustering — all through a single API.

> Mirrors the Predexon **v2 Data API** (`docs.predexon.com/openapi-v2.json`). Predexon's separate Trading API (order placement, fund management) is intentionally not exposed.
